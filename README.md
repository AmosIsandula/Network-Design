# Network-Design
IT Network design and configuration Simulation using CISCO PACKET tracer
The Network Comprises of switches, a router, IP telephony, VOIP, servers and printers
The network is designed for private acess with an IP Address private to the company given at departmental levels to create a small network based on specific purpose of the organization.
We have a SALES department, The PRODUCTION department, and the FINANCE department
We have a DNS SERVER, an EMAIL server, HTTP server and a ROUTER
IP ADDRESSING WAS DONE STATICALLY for ease of network problem identification with labelling of the statically addressed newtork components
In each segment we have a range of excluded addresses that can be assigned to printers
When connecting to the internet to make the severs resources available to the public, there will arise security issues. Inbound internet traffic is monitored to protect the internal network from attacks.
VOIP telephones are configured at the server
Firewall is desigend based on the two rule actions ALLOW and DENY. 
The newtork is desinged with flat architecture to avoid network loops
